**REST概念驗證**  
 
REST 風格的 API 不只是用 Http 來傳輸，並且利用 Http 規格來定義溝通的結果。

HTTP Status |HttpStatus constant |說明
---|---|---
200 | OK | Successful GET with returned content
201 | CREATED | Successful PUT or POST (when PUT introduces data that was not recorded previously in the database, PUT can be implemented to behave as a POST), should return a location header that contains the URI of new resource or response containing new resource.
204 |NO_CONTENT|Empty response, after successful PUT or DELETE
404 |NOT_FOUND|Resource was not found.
403 |FORBIDDEN|Server is refusing to respond to the request, because the request is not authorized.
405 |METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED|Http method is not supported for the resource identified by the Request-URI. Web servers can be configured to allow or disallow any method. Also, a handler method might not be declared for the HTTP method requested.
409 |CONFLICT|Problems when making changes, when PUT or POST try to save data that already exists and is marked as unique.
415 |UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE|The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.
